# Text Mining using R and Python
Text mining is the process of exploring and analyzing large amounts of unstructured text data assisted by software that can identify concepts, patterns, topics, keywords, and other attributes in the data. This is also known as text analysis, although some people draw a distinction between the two terms; in that view, text analytics is an application enabled by the use of text mining techniques to sort through data sets.
Text mining has similar properties to data mining, but with a focus on text rather than more structured forms of data. Sentiment analysis is a widely used text mining application that can track customer sentiment about a company. Also known as opinion mining, sentiment analysis mines text from online reviews, social networks, email, call center interactions, and other data sources to identify common threads that lead to positive or negative feelings on the part of customers. Such information can be used to fix product problems, improve customer service, and plan new marketing campaigns.
